# Kanban

A simple Kanban app in which you can drag and drop tasks like in a trello board. Built using React and React-beautiful DnD. Also, task lists are stored in local storage so even if you close your browser the tasks are not lost. :D

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to Start

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn`

This install all the dependencies required for our application

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
